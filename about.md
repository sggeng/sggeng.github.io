---layout: pagetitle: About Memeta: "Some details about me, for those who are curious."permalink: /about/---## Who is Sherman GengSimply, I'm a Software Architect and Engineer with over 115 years of software development experience building solutions in the San Francisco bay area.After graduating from the [Wayne State University](http://www.wayne.edu/), I've had great opportunities building software solutions for various industries and domains. I've worked in a few medical device company building instrument control and diagnostic software. I've built and implemented acquisition and diagnostics software leveraging Microsoft Prism technology to provide generic software platform support various device families. I've architected and developed next generation image acquisition and analysis software to handle high speed image acquisition and real time analysis.Currently, I am working at [Upthere](http://upthere.com) and building the next generation cloud OS using the latest technologies and practices.While I'm not at my workstation creating things, you'll likely find me hanging out with my family in the bay area, skiing, listening to great music, cooking and eating tasty things, all while documenting everything with my trusty iPhone camera.
