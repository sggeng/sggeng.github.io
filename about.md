## Who is Sherman Geng

Simply, I'm a Software Architect and Engineer with over 15 years of software development experience building solutions in San Francisco Bay Area.

After graduating from the [Wayne State University](http://www.wayne.edu/), I've had great opportunities building software solutions for various industries and domains. I've worked in a few medical device company building instrument control and diagnostic software. I've built and implemented data acquisition and analysis software leveraging microsoft Prism to provide a generic software platform for future feature developments. 

Currently, I am working at [Upthere](http://www.upthere.com) and building next generation cloud OS using the latest technologies and practices.

While I'm not at my workstation creating things, you'll likely find me hanging out with my family in the bay area, skiing, listening to great music and eating tasty things, all while documenting everything with my trusty iPhone camera.
