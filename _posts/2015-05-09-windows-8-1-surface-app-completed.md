We just completed a Windows 8.1 project designed for Microsoft Surface devices, which I've been working on for a while.  It will be used by a number of NFL football teams, including my home town Seattle Seahawks (go hawks!).  It was a lot of fun, and a great experience.  It will be even more exciting to watch the Seahawks play later this year :-)
